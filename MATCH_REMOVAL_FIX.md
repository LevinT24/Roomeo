# Match Removal Fix - Summary

## Problem
Users reported that removed matches were reappearing in the matches page after refresh, and removed users weren't showing up in the swipe/discovery page again.

## Root Cause Analysis
Through systematic debugging, we identified **two separate issues**:

### Issue 1: Incomplete Match Removal Logic
- **Problem**: The `removeMatch` function only deleted one direction of mutual matches
- **Details**: Mutual matches create two database records:
  - `{user_id: A, matched_user_id: B, liked: true}`
  - `{user_id: B, matched_user_id: A, liked: true}`
- **Impact**: Only one record was being deleted, leaving the reverse match intact

### Issue 2: Row-Level Security (RLS) Policy Restrictions
- **Problem**: Database RLS policies were blocking deletion operations
- **Details**: Error: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "matches"`
- **Impact**: Even with correct logic, database permissions prevented deletion

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Bidirectional Match Removal
**File**: `services/matches.ts`
**Change**: Updated `removeMatch` function to delete BOTH directions

```javascript
// OLD: Only removed one direction
.eq('user_id', userId)
.eq('matched_user_id', matchedUserId)

// NEW: Removes both directions
.or(`and(user_id.eq.${userId},matched_user_id.eq.${matchedUserId},liked.eq.true),and(user_id.eq.${matchedUserId},matched_user_id.eq.${userId},liked.eq.true)`)
```

### 2. Fixed Profile Visibility Bug (Bonus Fix)
**File**: `hooks/useAuth.ts`
**Issue**: `profilevisible` database field wasn't being mapped to user object
**Fix**: Added mapping: `profileVisible: profile.profilevisible ?? true`

### 3. Fixed RLS Policies on Matches Table
**Problem**: Multiple overlapping RLS policies causing conflicts
**Solution**: Cleaned up policies and kept one comprehensive policy

**SQL executed**:
```sql
-- Removed conflicting policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their matches" ON matches;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create matches" ON matches; 
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their matches" ON matches;

-- Kept comprehensive policy that handles all operations
-- "Enable match operations for authenticated users" (ALL operations)
```

## Final State

### Database
- ✅ Single comprehensive RLS policy allowing all match operations
- ✅ Proper UUID type handling in policies
- ✅ Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their matches

### Code
- ✅ Bidirectional match removal in `services/matches.ts`
- ✅ 500ms delay in match removal callback to ensure DB consistency
- ✅ Proper state clearing in SwipePage refresh mechanism
- ✅ Profile visibility properly mapped from database

### User Experience
- ✅ Removed matches disappear permanently from matches page
- ✅ Removed users reappear in discovery/swipe page
- ✅ No more matches reappearing after page refresh
- ✅ Profile visibility toggle works correctly
- ✅ Better user feedback during match removal

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `services/matches.ts` - Fixed bidirectional removal logic
2. `hooks/useAuth.ts` - Fixed profile visibility mapping
3. `app/page.tsx` - Added 500ms delay for DB consistency
4. `components/SwipePage.tsx` - Improved refresh mechanism
5. `components/MatchesPage.tsx` - Enhanced user feedback

### Database Changes
- Cleaned up RLS policies on `matches` table
- Ensured proper UUID type handling in policy conditions

### Testing Approach
- Created debug scripts to test actual database operations
- Identified RLS policy conflicts through systematic testing
- Verified bidirectional removal works with real user data

## Key Learnings
1. **Mutual matches require bidirectional cleanup** - both database records must be deleted
2. **RLS policies can block operations** even with correct application logic
3. **Type casting matters** - UUID vs text comparisons in PostgreSQL policies
4. **Multiple overlapping policies can conflict** - simpler is better
5. **Database-level debugging is crucial** for permission-related issues

## Prevention
- Always test database operations with real data and authentication
- Keep RLS policies simple and comprehensive rather than multiple specific ones
- Consider both directions when dealing with mutual/bidirectional relationships
- Include proper error handling and user feedback in match operations
