# 🚨 CRITICAL ACCOUNT DELETION FIX - Debug Guide

## Issue Summary
Account deletion appears to succeed (shows success message) but user records remain in the database. This indicates a **Row Level Security (RLS) policy issue**.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `users` table has RLS enabled but is **missing a DELETE policy**, preventing actual deletion while appearing to succeed.

---

## 🔧 STEP-BY-STEP FIX

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

**Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste this **COMPLETE** migration:

```sql
-- ===============================
-- Migration: Add User Account Deletion Support
-- Date: 2025-09-01  
-- Description: Comprehensive account deletion functionality with proper RLS policies
-- ===============================

-- Drop existing policy if it exists (for idempotency)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile" ON users;

-- Create DELETE policy for users table
-- This allows authenticated users to delete their own profile only
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile" ON users
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Verify CASCADE DELETE constraints exist for data cleanup
-- Check that related tables properly reference users(id) with ON DELETE CASCADE
DO $$
DECLARE
    constraint_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO constraint_count
    FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu 
        ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage ccu 
        ON tc.constraint_name = ccu.constraint_name
    WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
        AND ccu.table_name = 'users'
        AND ccu.column_name = 'id'
        AND tc.table_name IN ('matches', 'chats', 'messages', 'expenses', 'listings', 'notifications');
    
    IF constraint_count < 6 THEN
        RAISE WARNING 'Expected CASCADE DELETE constraints may be missing. Found % constraints.', constraint_count;
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'CASCADE DELETE constraints verified: % foreign key relationships found.', constraint_count;
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT DELETE ON users TO authenticated;

-- Verify setup
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Final verification
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
            AND tablename = 'users' 
            AND policyname = 'Users can delete their own profile'
    ) THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '✅ User DELETE policy successfully created and verified!';
        RAISE NOTICE '✅ Account deletion functionality is now enabled.';
    ELSE
        RAISE EXCEPTION '❌ Policy creation failed!';
    END IF;
END $$;
```

3. **Click "Run"** 
4. **Look for these success messages:**
   - `✅ User DELETE policy successfully created and verified!`
   - `✅ Account deletion functionality is now enabled.`

---

### Step 2: Verify Policy Was Created

**In Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor, run:**

```sql
-- Check if the DELETE policy exists
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'users' 
    AND policyname = 'Users can delete their own profile';
```

**Expected Result:**
- Should return 1 row showing the DELETE policy for users table
- `cmd` should be `DELETE`
- `qual` should be `(auth.uid() = id)`

---

### Step 3: Test Account Deletion

**Test the deletion with comprehensive logging:**

1. **Open your app and go to Settings**
2. **Open browser Developer Tools (F12)**
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Attempt account deletion**
5. **Check the detailed console logs**

The new debugging code will show:
- ✅ User ID and authentication verification
- ✅ Database existence check before deletion
- ✅ Detailed delete operation results
- ✅ Row count verification
- ✅ Post-deletion verification

---

### Step 4: Manual Database Verification

**If deletion still fails, manually verify in Supabase:**

```sql
-- 1. Check if user exists before deletion attempt
SELECT id, email, name FROM users WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE';

-- 2. After deletion attempt, check if user still exists
SELECT id, email, name FROM users WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE';

-- 3. Check auth.users table as well
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE';
```

---

### Step 5: Advanced Debugging (If Still Failing)

**Check RLS Policy Enforcement:**

```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled on users table
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'users';
-- rowsecurity should be 't' (true)

-- List ALL policies on users table
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'users';

-- Test policy directly (replace with your user ID)
SELECT auth.uid(), id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

**Check Foreign Key Constraints:**

```sql
-- Verify CASCADE DELETE constraints
SELECT
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name,
    rc.delete_rule
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.referential_constraints AS rc
    ON tc.constraint_name = rc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
    AND ccu.table_name = 'users'
    AND ccu.column_name = 'id';
-- delete_rule should be 'CASCADE'
```

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Issue: "No rows were deleted"
**Cause:** RLS policy not applied correctly
**Solution:** Re-run Step 1 migration, verify with Step 2

### Issue: "User still exists after deletion"
**Cause:** Foreign key constraints or auth.users not cleaned up
**Solution:** Check CASCADE DELETE constraints with Step 5 queries

### Issue: "Authentication error"
**Cause:** User session invalid
**Solution:** Sign out and sign back in, then retry

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Cause:** Missing GRANT permission
**Solution:** Ensure `GRANT DELETE ON users TO authenticated;` was executed

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

**✅ Migration applied successfully**
**✅ DELETE policy exists in pg_policies**
**✅ Console shows "Successfully deleted X row(s)"**
**✅ User record no longer exists in database**
**✅ Related data cleaned up via CASCADE DELETE**

---

## 📞 ESCALATION

If all steps fail:
1. **Check browser console for specific error messages**
2. **Run the advanced debugging SQL queries**
3. **Verify your Supabase project permissions**
4. **Consider recreating the users table with proper constraints**

The comprehensive logging in the updated code will pinpoint exactly where the deletion is failing.
