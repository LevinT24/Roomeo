# Splitwise Fix - Project Plan

## Problem Analysis
After running the rollback script, Splitwise rooms are not showing up because:

1. **Missing `participants` field** - The rollback script created a `get_expense_summary` function that doesn't return the `participants` JSONB field that the frontend expects
2. **Missing `get_user_pending_settlements` function** - This function was dropped but the code still calls it
3. **Incorrect validation logic** - The rollback script had inconsistent validation rules compared to the original schema
4. **Function signature mismatches** - Some functions were recreated with slightly different logic

## Solution

### ✅ Step 1: Created Fixed Database Functions
- Created `FIXED-SPLITWISE-FUNCTIONS.sql` with corrected functions
- Fixed `get_expense_summary` to include the missing `participants` JSONB field
- Added the missing `get_user_pending_settlements` function
- Ensured all function signatures match what the code expects

### 🔄 Step 2: Apply the Fixed Script
- Run the fixed SQL script in Supabase to restore proper functionality
- This will fix the room creation and display issues

### ⏳ Step 3: Test the Fix
- Test creating a new expense room
- Verify existing rooms show up properly
- Confirm all Splitwise features work

## Todo Items

✅ Examine current database structure and Splitwise code  
✅ Identify why rooms aren't showing up after rollback  
✅ Check for any missing tables or data  
🔄 Fix the room creation issue  
⏳ Test that existing rooms are visible  

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed `create_expense_group` function**:
   - Proper validation (at least 1 participant for flexibility)
   - Correct custom amount validation
   - Proper participant addition logic

2. **Fixed `get_expense_summary` function**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Added back the missing `participants` JSONB field
   - This field contains all participants with their payment status
   - Frontend depends on this field to display room information

3. **Added `get_user_pending_settlements` function**:
   - Returns pending settlements for approval
   - Required for the dashboard to show pending settlements

4. **Restored all other functions**:
   - `submit_settlement`
   - `approve_settlement` 
   - `mark_participant_payment`

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Fixed SQL Script**:
   - Copy the contents of `FIXED-SPLITWISE-FUNCTIONS.sql`
   - Paste into your Supabase SQL Editor
   - Execute the script to restore proper functionality

2. **Test the Fix**:
   - Try creating a new expense room
   - Check if existing rooms now show up
   - Verify all Splitwise features work properly

## Files Created/Modified

### ✅ Created Files
- `schema/FIXED-SPLITWISE-FUNCTIONS.sql` - Fixed database functions

### 📝 Modified Files  
- `projectplan.md` - Updated with Splitwise fix documentation

## What The Fix Does

The key issue was that your rollback script removed the `participants` JSONB field from the `get_expense_summary` function return. This field is critical because:

1. **Frontend Dependency**: The ExpensesPage.tsx component expects each expense summary to have a `participants` field containing participant details
2. **Room Display**: Without this field, rooms cannot be properly displayed because participant information is missing
3. **Payment Status**: The participants field contains payment status for each user in the room

The fixed script restores this field and all missing functions your code depends on.
