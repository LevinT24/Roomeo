# Room Photo Upload and Display - Project Plan

## Overview
Implement comprehensive room photo upload and display functionality for Provider users in the Roomio app. This feature allows providers to showcase their living spaces and enables seekers to view detailed room photos during matching.

## Current Understanding
- **App Structure**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Supabase backend
- **User Types**: 'seeker' (looking for place) vs 'provider' (has place, needs roommates)
- **Existing Profile System**: ProfileSetup.tsx handles user type selection and basic profile creation
- **Swipe System**: SwipePage.tsx shows opposite user types, currently displays profile pictures
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with existing users table containing userType field

## Todo List

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Database and Storage Setup
- [ ] Create room_photos table with proper schema
- [ ] Set up RLS policies for photo security  
- [ ] Configure Supabase Storage bucket for room photos
- [ ] Test storage permissions and upload functionality

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Core Services  
- [ ] Create room photo service functions (upload, get, delete, reorder)
- [ ] Implement photo validation and compression utilities
- [ ] Add image optimization helpers (resize, format conversion)
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Photo Upload Components
- [ ] Build drag-and-drop photo upload component
- [ ] Create photo preview grid with management controls
- [ ] Add caption editing and primary photo selection
- [ ] Implement photo reordering via drag-and-drop

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Profile Integration
- [ ] Modify ProfileSetup.tsx to show room photo section for providers
- [ ] Add conditional rendering based on userType
- [ ] Integrate photo requirements validation
- [ ] Test profile setup flow end-to-end

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Swipe Page Enhancement  
- [ ] Update SwipePage.tsx to display room photos for provider cards
- [ ] Add photo count badge and indicators
- [ ] Create photo gallery modal with navigation
- [ ] Implement swipe gestures and keyboard controls

### ‚úÖ Phase 6: Photo Management Interface
- [ ] Create dedicated photo management page for providers
- [ ] Add bulk operations (delete multiple, reorder)
- [ ] Implement photo analytics (if needed)
- [ ] Add photo verification status

### ‚úÖ Phase 7: Mobile Optimization and Testing
- [ ] Ensure responsive design across all components
- [ ] Test touch gestures and mobile navigation
- [ ] Optimize image loading and caching
- [ ] Validate accessibility features

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE room_photos (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  photo_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  caption TEXT,
  is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Key Components to Create/Modify
- `RoomPhotoUpload.tsx` - Drag-and-drop upload interface
- `PhotoGalleryModal.tsx` - Full-screen photo viewer with navigation  
- `RoomPhotoManager.tsx` - Photo management interface for providers
- `SwipePage.tsx` - Modify to show room photos for providers
- `ProfileSetup.tsx` - Add conditional photo upload section

### Service Functions
- `uploadRoomPhotos()` - Handle multiple file uploads
- `getRoomPhotos()` - Fetch user's room photos
- `setPrimaryPhoto()` - Set main display photo
- `deleteRoomPhoto()` - Remove photo and update database
- `reorderPhotos()` - Update display order
- `updatePhotoCaption()` - Edit photo descriptions

## Success Criteria
1. Providers can upload multiple room photos during profile setup
2. Photos display properly in swipe interface with navigation
3. Photo management interface allows full CRUD operations
4. Mobile experience is smooth and responsive
5. Performance is optimized with proper image loading
6. Security is maintained with proper RLS policies

## Risk Mitigation
- **File Size**: Implement compression and validation (max 5MB per photo)
- **Storage Costs**: Limit to 15 photos per provider maximum  
- **Performance**: Use lazy loading and progressive image loading
- **Security**: Ensure proper RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- **Mobile UX**: Test thoroughly on various device sizes

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: Database and Services (Day 1)
- **Phase 3-4**: Upload Components and Profile Integration (Day 2) 
- **Phase 5-6**: Swipe Enhancement and Management (Day 3)
- **Phase 7**: Testing and Optimization (Day 4)

This plan prioritizes simple, modular changes that integrate smoothly with the existing codebase while providing a comprehensive room photo feature set.
