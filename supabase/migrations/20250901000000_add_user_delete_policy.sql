-- Migration: Add User Account Deletion Support
-- Date: 2025-09-01  
-- Description: Comprehensive account deletion functionality with proper RLS policies

-- Create DELETE policy for users table
-- This allows authenticated users to delete their own profile only
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile" ON users
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Verify CASCADE DELETE constraints exist for data cleanup
-- Check that related tables properly reference users(id) with ON DELETE CASCADE
