## Standard Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to projectplan.md
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, making them as complete as you go
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want yo avoid making massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity
7. Finally, add a review section to the projectplan.md file with a summary of the change you made and any other relevant information

## APP Idea:
Welcome to the **Roomio** codebase. This is a roommate/housing matching web app built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, and **Supabase**. The app lets users create a profile with one of two types:

- `"Looking for Roommates"` (they have an apartment and need roommates)
- `"Looking for Owners"` (they're looking for a place)

On the swipe/matching page, users should only see **profiles of the opposite type**.

## ðŸ§­ Project Goals

- Implement and refine the matching system based on user type
- Ensure authentication and profile setup flow works correctly
- Keep the project structure clean and modular
- Make simple, isolated changes â€” avoid large refactors unless necessary
- Later we are going to add the marketplace feature
- Then we are going to add Splitwise payment feature
- Chat feature for added friends
- we have working chat feature for matched profiles
